## Dataset
We construct a new dataset, named AuDio Visual Aerial sceNe reCognition datasEt (ADVANCE), providing 5075 paired images and sound clips categorized to 13 scenes, for exploring the aerial scene recognition task. You can download the dataset [here](https://zenodo.org/record/3828124).

## Usage
The three branchs of cross-modal transfer methods are in the model/ folder.
